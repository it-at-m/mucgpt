MUCGPT is a system that enables users to interact with a large language model (LLM) through a web interface. This interaction is facilitated by an agentic system that can access several tools. To get a feel for it, take a look at our [demo frontend](https://it-at-m.github.io/mucgpt/).

Roles and rights management is facilitated by access to an OpenID Connect provider.

Users can create their own assistants and share them within the organisation.  A personal assistant is a configuration of the MUCGPT agent, particularly the activated tools and system prompts.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/it-at-m/mucgpt/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).

## 🛠️ Built With

### Backend

- [Python 3.10, 3.11 or 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph)

### Frontend

- [React](https://de.react.dev/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Javascript](https://wiki.selfhtml.org/wiki/JavaScript)

### Deployment

- [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Python 3.12
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
- Docker

## 🏃‍♂️‍➡️ Getting started

- Install uv: <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/>
  - [Using UV during development](/docs/DEVELOPMENT.md)
- Install [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)


### ⚙️ Configure

Configure your environment. For that, copy the content of the empty config from [/config/.env.empty](/config/.env.empty) to the stack directory [stack/.env](stack/.env). Add at least one model by providing one OpenAI compatible endpoint.

### 🐋 Run with Docker

To start all required services using podman or docker run:

```bash
# in case of podman run
podman compose  --build up
# in case of docker run
docker-compose  --build up
```

This command launches the following components:

- **Frontend**: A modern web interface built with React, providing users with an intuitive and responsive experience directly in their browser.
- **Core-Service**: Manages the agent to call LLMs. Also orchestrates tool usage.
- **Assistant-Service**: Manages assistants. An Assistant is an configuratoin for an MUCGPT-Agent.
- **Assistant-Service-Migration**: Does database migrations on startup.
- **API Gateway**: Serves as the unified entry point for all client requests, efficiently routing traffic to backend services while managing authentication and security.
- **Keycloak**: A robust, open-source identity and access management system responsible for authentication, authorization, and user administration.
- **PostgresDB**: A reliable PostgreSQL database used to securely store and manage app statistics.

Once all services are running, you can access:

- The frontend at `localhost:8083` (Username: `mucgpt-user`, Password: `mucgpt`)
- The Keycloak admin panel at `localhost:8100` (Username: `admin`, Password: `admin`)
- The PGAdmin panel at `localhost:5050` (Username: `admin`, Password: `admin`)

Keycloak simulates a Single Sign-On (SSO) service, allowing you to log in to the frontend using the provided credentials (`mucgpt-user` / `mucgpt`).

## 📃 Documentation

  <img alt="MUCGPT Architecture Diagram" src="docs/architecture.png">
</picture>

The architecture of MUCGPT is structured into three primary components: the frontend, the core service for handling tools and the communication with the llm, and the assistant service. Additionally, it features an API Gateway, a database, and integrates Single Sign-On (SSO) for authentication.

The frontend is based on a template from [Microsoft Azure](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo) and is implemented using React, Typescript and Javascript.

The framework used to implement the backends (the core- and the assistant service) of MUCGPT is called [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). It is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints. The `core service` uses LangGraph to connect to LLMs.
TODO more about the services.

The API Gateway is developed in Java based on the [Spring Cloud Gateway](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-gateway), providing robust routing, security, and scalability for all services. [IT@M](https://github.com/it-at-m) distributes the gateway as a container image: `ghcr.io/it-at-m/refarch/refarch-gateway`. For detailed documentation, see [here](https://refarch.oss.muenchen.de/gateway.html).

Authentication is managed using [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/), a robust open-source identity and access management solution. Keycloak handles user authentication, authorization, and user management for the MUCGPT platform, enabling secure Single Sign-On (SSO) across all services.
For more details on customizing authentication or extending user management, refer to the [Keycloak Migration Framework documentation](https://mayope.github.io/keycloakmigration/).

[Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) is an open-source LLM observability platform that supports agent tracing and prompt management. It is optional in MUCGPT.
