area.
Action: Search[Colorado orogeny]
Observation: <info1.pdf> The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in
Colorado and surrounding areas.
Thought: It does not mention the eastern sector. So I need to look up eastern
sector.
Action: Lookup[eastern sector]
Observation: <info2.txt> (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called
the Central Plains orogeny.
Thought: The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains. So I
need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.
Action: Search[High Plains]
Observation: <some_file.pdf> High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions
Thought: I need to instead search High Plains (United States).
Action: Search[High Plains (United States)]
Observation: <filea.pdf> The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains. <another-ref.docx> From east to west, the
High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130
m).
Thought: High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer
is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.

Action: Search[Milhouse]
Observation: <info7.pdf> Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated
television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt
Groening.
Thought: The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up
"named after".
Action: Lookup[named after]
Observation: <historyref2.txt> (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose

politician, not Finnish rock groups. So the documentary about Finnish rock
groups must instead be The Saimaa Gesture.
