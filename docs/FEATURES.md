# Features
In the following some important Features of MUCGPT are listed. Future Features are listed in the [Roadmap](/README.md/#-Roadmap).  
  
Currently MUCGPT is seperated in the areas [Chat](#chat) to chat with the LLM, [Summarize](#summarize) to summarize long texts and files and [Brainstorming](#brainstorming) to get a mindmap about a given topic.

## Chat
![Chat](/docs/chatscreen.png)  
The chat feature of MUCGPT is a typical known chatroom where you can text wit the LLM to get Inormations about nearly everything.  
MUCGPT is capable of generating responses that closely resemble those of a human, due to the large pre-trained language model it uses. It has a number of features and abilities that enable it to engage in natural language processing, multi-turn conversations, personalization, sentiment analysis, knowledge retrieval, and task completion. These capabilities allow MUCGPT to understand and respond to user queries in a way that is tailored to their needs, making it a powerful tool for all usecases where human-like interaction is desired.  
In addition, MUCGPT allows users to configure a system prompt that is added as a prefix to every message sent by the user. The temperature of the generated response can also be adjusted, which controls the randomness or creativity of the model's output.
## Summarize
![Sum](/docs/sum.png)
The Summarize feature allows users to condense long texts or documents and extract the most important information to create a new, summarized text. The user can adjust the level of detail of the generated response in three stages (short, medium, long).
## Brainstorming

The Brainstorming feature enables users to generate mind maps to help them find inspiration on a given topic.
