MUCGPT is a system that enables users to interact with a large language model (LLM) through a web interface. This interaction is facilitated by an agentic system that can access several tools. To get a feel for it, take a look at our [demo frontend](https://it-at-m.github.io/mucgpt/).

Roles and rights management is facilitated by access to an OpenID Connect provider.

Users can create their own assistants and share them within the organisation. A personal assistant is a configuration of the MUCGPT agent, particularly the activated tools and system prompts.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/it-at-m/mucgpt/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Python 3.12
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
- Docker

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è Getting started

- Install uv: <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/>
  - [Using UV during development](/docs/DEVELOPMENT.md)
- Install [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configure the environment

Configuration can be found in form of an .env file

```bash
cd stack
cp .env.example .env
```

Below is an example of how to configure the `MUCGPT_CORE_BACKEND__MODELS` environment variable in your `.env` file. This variable defines the available LLM models for the core backend as a JSON array. Each object in the array specifies the model type, name, endpoint, API key, token limits, and a description.

```env
MUCGPT_CORE_BACKEND__MODELS='[
  {
    "type": "OPENAI",
    "llm_name": "<your-llm-name>",
    "endpoint": "<your-endpoint>",
    "api_key": "<your-sk>",
    "max_output_tokens": "<number>",
    "max_input_tokens": "<number>",
    "description": "<description>"
  }
]'
```

**Field descriptions:**

- `type`: The provider type (e.g., `OPENAI`).
- `llm_name`: The name or identifier of your LLM model.
- `endpoint`: The API endpoint URL for the model.
- `api_key`: The API key or secret for authentication.
- `max_output_tokens`: Maximum number of tokens the model can generate in a response.
- `max_input_tokens`: Maximum number of tokens accepted as input.
- `description`: A human-readable description of the model.

Replace the placeholder values with your actual model configuration.


### üêã Run with Docker

To start all required services using podman or docker run:

```bash
# in case of podman run
podman compose  --build up
# in case of docker run
docker-compose  --build up
```

This command launches the following components:

- **Frontend**: A modern web interface built with React, providing users with an intuitive and responsive experience directly in their browser.
- **Core-Service**: Manages the agent to call LLMs. Also orchestrates tool usage.
- **Assistant-Service**: Manages assistants. An assistant is a configuration for an MUCGPT agent.
- **Assistant-Service-Migration**: Does database migrations on startup.
- **API Gateway**: Serves as the unified entry point for all client requests, efficiently routing traffic to backend services while managing authentication and security.
- **Keycloak**: A robust, open-source identity and access management system responsible for authentication, authorization, and user administration.
- **PostgresDB**: A reliable PostgreSQL database used to securely store and manage app statistics.

Once all services are running, you can access:

- The frontend at `localhost:8083` (Username: `mucgpt-user`, Password: `mucgpt`)
- The Keycloak admin panel at `localhost:8100` (Username: `admin`, Password: `admin`)
- The PGAdmin panel at `localhost:5050` (Username: `admin`, Password: `admin`)

Keycloak simulates a Single Sign-On (SSO) service, allowing you to log in to the frontend using the provided credentials (`mucgpt-user` / `mucgpt`).

## Architecture Overview

MUCGPT uses a modern microservices architecture optimized for scalability and maintainability:

- **Frontend**: User interface layer built with React
- **API Gateway**: Entry point for all client requests
- **Core Service**: LLM agent orchestration and tool integration
- **Assistant Service**: Configuration management for assistants
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for persistence
- **Keycloak**: Authentication and user management

  <img alt="MUCGPT Architecture Diagram" src="docs/architecture.png">
</picture>

The architecture of MUCGPT is structured into these primary components: the frontend, the core service for handling tools and the communication with the LLM, and the assistant service. Additionally, it features an API Gateway, a database, and integrates Single Sign-On (SSO) for authentication.

The frontend is based on a template from [Microsoft Azure](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo) and is implemented using React, Typescript and Javascript.

The framework used to implement the backends (the core- and the assistant service) of MUCGPT is called [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). It is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints. The `core service` uses LangGraph to connect to LLMs.
Each service provides specialized functionality:

- **Core Service**: Manages LLM interactions and orchestrates tools. It uses LangGraph to create an agent architecture that can process user requests, call appropriate tools, and generate responses.

- **Assistant Service**: Manages the creation, modification, and sharing of assistant configurations. These configurations define which tools are available to an agent and what system prompts guide their behavior.

- **Migration Service**: Handles database migrations for the Assistant Service, ensuring schema updates are applied consistently.

The API Gateway is developed in Java based on the [Spring Cloud Gateway](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-gateway), providing robust routing, security, and scalability for all services. [IT@M](https://github.com/it-at-m) distributes the gateway as a container image: `ghcr.io/it-at-m/refarch/refarch-gateway`. For detailed documentation, see the [gateway documentation](https://refarch.oss.muenchen.de/gateway.html).

Authentication is managed using [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/), a robust open-source identity and access management solution. Keycloak handles user authentication, authorization, and user management for the MUCGPT platform, enabling secure Single Sign-On (SSO) across all services.
For more details on customizing authentication or extending user management, refer to the [Keycloak Migration Framework documentation](https://mayope.github.io/keycloakmigration/).

[Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) is an open-source LLM observability platform that supports agent tracing and prompt management. It is optional in MUCGPT.

For more information, see the [MUCGPT Features documentation](/docs/FEATURES.md).
