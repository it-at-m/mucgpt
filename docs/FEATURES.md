# Features
In the following some important Features of MUCGPT are listed. Future Features are listed in the [Roadmap](/README.md/#-Roadmap).  
  
Currently MUCGPT is divided into the areas [Chat](#chat) to chat with the underlying LLM, [Summarize](#summarize) to summarize long texts and files and [Brainstorming](#brainstorming) to get a mind map on a given topic.

## Chat
![Chat](/docs/chatscreen.png)  
The chat feature of MUCGPT is a typical chat room where you can text with the LLM to get information about almost anything.  
MUCGPT is able to generate responses that closely resemble those of a human because of the large pre-trained language model it uses. It has a number of features and capabilities that enable it to perform natural language processing, multi-turn conversations, personalisation, sentiment analysis, knowledge retrieval and task completion. These capabilities allow MUCGPT to understand and respond to user queries in a way that is tailored to their needs, making it a powerful tool for any use case where human-like interaction is desired.  
In addition, MUCGPT allows users to configure a system prompt that is added as a prefix to any message sent by the user. The temperature of the generated response can also be adjusted, controlling the randomness or creativity of the model's output.

## Summarize
![Sum](/docs/sum.png)
The Summarize feature allows users to condense long texts or documents and extract the most relevant information to create a new, summarized text. The user can adjust the level of detail of the generated answer in three levels (short, medium, long).
## Brainstorming

The Brainstorming feature allows users to create mind maps to help them find inspiration on a given topic.
The resulting mindmaps can be downloaded and further processed using [Freeplane](https://docs.freeplane.org/).
## General Features
Generated text in various formats is displayed correctly. The formats currently supported are
- Markdown
